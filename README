HTTP::DAV - A WebDAV client library for Perl5

   This is DAV.pm (or HTTP::DAV), a Perl5 library for interacting 
   and modifying content on webservers using the WebDAV protocol. Now 
   you can LOCK, DELETE and PUT files and much more on a DAV-enabled 
   webserver. Learn more about WebDAV at http://www.webdav.org/

WARNING
   This software is still being developed!!
   Not even alpha status yet!!
   It does function though. Please help to finish it.

HOW DO I INSTALL IT?
   Retrieve the latest copy from http://www.webdav.org/perldav/HTTP-DAV-0.2.tar.gz
   To install this module, cd to the directory that contains this README 
   file and type the following:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test (may fail if you don't have internet access)
      make install

WHAT ARE THE PREREQUISITES?
    - LWP       (Have not tested lower than v5.48)
    - XML::DOM  (Have not tested lower than v1.26)
    - Perl      (Have not tested lower than v5.005)

   To get the latest versions of these prerequisite modules you can 
   simply type this at the command prompt:
      $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
      cpan> install LWP
      cpan> install XML::DOM

AN EXAMPLE
   use HTTP::DAV;
   
   $dav = HTTP::DAV->new;
   $dav->credentials( "pcollins", "mypass", "http://localhost/" );
   $resource = $dav->new_resource( -uri => "http://localhost/dav/myfile.txt" );
   
   $response = $resource->lock;
   $response = $resource->put("New file contents\n");
   print "BAD PUT\n" unless $response->is_success;
   $response = $resource->unlock;
   
   $resource->propfind;
   print "BAD PROPFIND\n" unless $response->is_success;
   $getlastmodified = $resource->get_property( "getlastmodified" );
   print "Last modified $getlastmodified\n";


WHAT SYSTEMS DOES IT WORK WITH?
   At the moment, this module is still in development, and as such 
   I haven't had the time to test it on anything other than Linux.

TODO
   - COPY, MOVE and PROPPATCH are not yet implemented
   - DAV::Client?? A funky client to simplify all of the raw resource commands.
   - DAV command line programs.
   - Namespaces are not currently supported. I munge around them since 
     they are not supported in DOM1 which is what XML::DOM uses.
   - testing against Zope
   - Rework Response.pm now that LWP::Status supports the status codes.

   - On the wishlist
      - support for LWPng which is fully HTTP/1.1 compliant.
      - DAV Bindings
      - DAV Redirects Reference
      - DAV Orderered collections
      - DAV DASL support
      - DAV Delta-V
      - DAV ACL's
   
BUGS
Yes. Many.
 - Locking is still fairly buggered at the moment.
 - The Response.pm module needs considerable work to allow access to 
   the multistatus responses.
