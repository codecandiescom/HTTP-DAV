HTTP::DAV - A WebDAV client library for Perl5

WHAT IS IT?
   This is HTTP::DAV (a.k.a PerlDAV), a Perl5 library for interacting
   and modifying content on webservers using the WebDAV protocol. Now
   you can LOCK, DELETE and PUT files and much more on a DAV-enabled
   webserver. Learn more about WebDAV at http://www.webdav.org/

WARNING
   This is alpha software. 
   It does function but please be careful not to use it in production.
   Please help to finish PerlDAV. There is a TODO list at the bottom of
   this file.

AN EXAMPLE SCRIPT
   use HTTP::DAV;

   $dav = HTTP::DAV->new;
   $dav->credentials( "pcollins", "mypass", "http://localhost/" );
   $resource = $dav->new_resource( -uri => "http://localhost/dav/myfile.txt" );
 
   $response = $resource->lock;
   $response = $resource->put("New file contents\n");
   print "BAD PUT\n" unless $response->is_success;
   $response = $resource->unlock;
   
   $resource->propfind;
   print "BAD PROPFIND\n" unless $response->is_success;
   $getlastmodified = $resource->get_property( "getlastmodified" );
   print "Last modified $getlastmodified\n";

HOW DO I INSTALL IT?

   The lazy way:
      $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
      cpan> install HTTP::DAV
   
   or the manual way:
      Retrieve the latest copy from CPAN: 
      http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/P/PC/PCOLLINS/
      $ perl Makefile.PL
      $ make
      $ make test
      $ make install

WHERE ARE THE MANUALS?
   Once you've installed HTTP::DAV, you can type: 
   $ perldoc HTTP::DAV
   $ perldoc HTTP::DAV::Resource

GETTING HELP

   The perldav mailing list
   There is a mailing list for PerlDAV for use by Developers and Users.
   Please see http://mailman.webdav.org/mailman/listinfo/perldav

WHAT ARE THE PREREQUISITES?

   - LWP (Have not tested lower than v5.48) 
   - XML::DOM (Have not tested lower than v1.26) 
   - Perl (Have not tested lower than v5.005) 

   To get the latest versions of these prerequisite modules you can
   simply type this at the command prompt:

   $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
   cpan> install LWP
   cpan> install XML::DOM

   or if you just 'install HTTP::DAV' the lovely CPAN module 
   should just magically install all of the prerequisites for you.

WHAT SYSTEMS DOES IT WORK WITH?

   At the moment, this module is still in development, and as such I 
   haven't had the time to test it on anything other than Linux. But
   given that it is all pure Perl and no .xs or C-code it should be
   fairly portable. I have had few complaints about interop issues.

BUGS
   Locking is getting better but probably still has bugs.
   The Response.pm module needs considerable work to allow access 
   to the multistatus responses.
