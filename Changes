Revision history for PerlDAV

  v0.23 (released 2001/09/07):

    *   file globbing for get and put

        HTTP::DAV::get() and HTTP::DAV::put() now supports file globs. This
        functionality also propagates to dave. This allows you to do the
        following:

         dav> put /tmp/index*.html
         dav> get index[12].htm? /tmp

         ?,* and sets ([]) are supported. See the docs for details.

        HTTP::DAV now requires the Perl module File::Glob which comes
        bundled with perl5.6 and later.

    *   bug fix in -overwrite flag in HTTP::DAV::copy/move.

  v0.22 (released 2001/09/03)

    Complete overhaul of API, recursive get and put, addition of dave.

    *   dave -- the new command line client

        I wrote dave (the DAV Explorer) because I needed an end-user
        application that allowed me to "feel" how well the HTTP::DAV API was
        performing. dave is quite similar to Joe Orton's C-based DAV client
        called cadaver (yes, imitation is the best form of flattery).

    *   A new and simpler API

        This new API is accessed directly through the HTTP::DAV module and
        is based on the core API written in previous releases.

    *   new methods

        The new API now supports, proppatch, recursive get and put.

    *   A substantial core API overhaul

        Moving from v0.05 to v0.22 in one release might indicate the amount
        of work gone into this release.

    *   A new interoperability test suite

        is now included in PerlDAV. The test suite is built on top of the
        standard Perl Test::Harness modules. Still in development, the test
        suite is highlighting interoperability problems with DAV-servers a
        lot quicker than before. See the the test suite & interoperability
        entry elsewhere in this document section.
