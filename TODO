TODO
   - COPY, MOVE and PROPPATCH are not yet implemented
   - DAV::Client?? A funky client to simplify all of the raw resource commands.
   - DAV command line programs.
   - Namespaces are not currently supported. I munge around them since
     they are not supported in DOM1 which is what XML::DOM uses.
   - testing against Zope
   - Rework Response.pm now that LWP::Status supports the status codes.

   - On the wishlist
      - support for LWPng which is fully HTTP/1.1 compliant.
      - DAV Bindings
      - DAV Redirects Reference
      - DAV Orderered collections
      - DAV DASL support
      - DAV Delta-V
      - DAV ACL's
