       - multistatus responses don't come through nicely.

  DAV.pm

       - redo POD for DAV.pm, Resource.pm
       - dist prog to remove all login details

       - setup_if_headers need to get just Rsource's locks not all RL's locks.
       - discovery still isn't resetting locks properly ????
       - DAV.pm as_string needs working resource
       - finish lock (bug against mod_dav somewhere)

       - mod t/* for IIS 5 lock and proppatch deficiencies.
       - how to we handle degradation for incomplete servers in test suite (IIS)?

  Wishlist functions

       - try using LWP's Digest mechanism, https and http11.pm 
       - testing against Zope
       - dave:implement netrc?
       - dave:tab completion? history?
       - dave:implement more advanced command-line interaction

  Wishlist projects

       - Namespaces are not currently supported. I munge around them since
         they are not supported in DOM1 which is what XML::DOM uses.
       - Rework Response.pm now that LWP::Status supports the status codes.

       - support for LWPng which is fully HTTP/1.1 compliant.
       - DAV Bindings
       - DAV Redirects Reference
       - DAV Ordered collections
       - DAV DASL support
       - DAV Delta-V
